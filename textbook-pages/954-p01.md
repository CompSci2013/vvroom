## Angular Terms

### Change Detection
The process by which Angular checks component properties for changes and updates the DOM accordingly. Can be triggered manually via `ChangeDetectorRef.markForCheck()` or `detectChanges()`.

### Component
A building block of Angular applications consisting of a TypeScript class, HTML template, and optional CSS styles. Decorated with `@Component()`.

### Decorator
A TypeScript feature that adds metadata to classes, properties, or methods. Angular uses decorators like `@Component()`, `@Injectable()`, `@Input()`, and `@Output()`.

### Dependency Injection (DI)
A design pattern where a class receives its dependencies from external sources rather than creating them. Angular's DI system provides services to components.

### Directive
A class that modifies DOM elements or component behavior. Structural directives (`*ngIf`, `*ngFor`) change DOM structure; attribute directives modify appearance or behavior.

### Guard
A service that controls route access. Can prevent navigation (`CanActivate`), leaving (`CanDeactivate`), or loading (`CanLoad`).

### Interceptor
A service that intercepts HTTP requests and responses. Used for adding headers, handling errors, or transforming data globally.

### Lifecycle Hook
Methods that Angular calls at specific points in a component's lifecycle: `ngOnInit`, `ngOnChanges`, `ngAfterViewInit`, `ngOnDestroy`, etc.

### Module (NgModule)
A container for related components, directives, pipes, and services. Decorated with `@NgModule()`. Angular 13 uses NgModules (not standalone components).

### Observable
An RxJS type representing a stream of values over time. Components subscribe to observables to receive data. See also: RxJS Terms.

### Pipe
A function that transforms data in templates. Built-in examples: `| json`, `| async`, `| date`. Custom pipes transform domain-specific data.
