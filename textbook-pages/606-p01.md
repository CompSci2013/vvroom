# 606: Chart Configs

## Learning Objectives

After completing this section, you will:
- Understand how chart configurations separate visualization metadata from data transformation
- Know the relationship between chart configs and chart data sources
- Recognize the pattern of declarative chart definition

---

## Objective

Create the automobile chart configurations that define which charts appear in the statistics panel. These configurations specify chart identity, type, dimensions, and which data source transforms the statistics into chart data.

---

## Why

Visualizations help users understand data patterns. For automobiles, we want charts showing:

1. **Manufacturer distribution** — Which manufacturers have the most vehicles?
2. **Model distribution** — Which specific models are most common?
3. **Year distribution** — How are vehicles distributed across years?
4. **Body class distribution** — What types of vehicles are in the data?

Without configuration, you might create each chart as a separate component:

```typescript
@Component({
  template: `
    <div class="chart-container">
      <h3>Manufacturers</h3>
      <plotly-plot [data]="manufacturerData" [layout]="layout"></plotly-plot>
    </div>
  `
})
export class ManufacturerChartComponent {
  // Transform statistics to chart data
  // Handle Plotly configuration
  // Manage visibility
  // ...50+ lines of code
}
```

Four charts = four components = 200+ lines of similar code.

With configuration:

```typescript
export const AUTOMOBILE_CHART_CONFIGS: ChartConfig[] = [
  { id: 'manufacturer-distribution', title: 'Manufacturers', dataSourceId: 'manufacturer', ... },
  { id: 'year-distribution', title: 'Year', dataSourceId: 'year', ... },
  // ...
];
```

One generic `BaseChartComponent` + configuration = minimal code.

**This is the Phase 6 Aha Moment again:** Configuration is declarative code. You describe what charts you want, not how to render them.
