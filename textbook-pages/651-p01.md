**Depends On:** 403-automobile-statistics-model, 606-chart-configs
**Blocks:** 801-base-chart-component

## Learning Objectives

After completing this section, you will:
- Understand how chart data sources transform domain statistics into visualization-ready formats
- Know how to implement the abstract `ChartDataSource` class for a specific data type
- Be able to handle both simple and segmented (highlighted) statistics in chart transformations

---

## Objective

Create the manufacturer chart data source that transforms vehicle statistics into a Plotly.js vertical stacked bar chart showing vehicle count by manufacturer. This chart source handles both simple counts and segmented statistics (with highlighted vs. non-highlighted data).

---

## Why

Charts are one of the most powerful ways to communicate data insights. However, raw statistics from an API rarely match the exact format that charting libraries expect. We need a transformation layer between our domain data and our visualization library.

**The Chart Data Source Pattern:**

```
VehicleStatistics  →  ManufacturerChartDataSource  →  Plotly Chart Data
     (domain)              (transformer)                 (visualization)
```

This separation provides several benefits:

1. **Single Responsibility** — The chart component handles rendering; the data source handles transformation
2. **Testability** — Data transformations can be unit tested without rendering actual charts
3. **Reusability** — The same `BaseChartComponent` works with any data source
4. **Flexibility** — Changing the chart appearance only requires modifying the data source, not the component

### URL-First Architecture Reference

Chart sources connect to the URL-First pattern through click handling. When a user clicks a bar in the manufacturer chart, the data source converts that click into URL parameters (e.g., `manufacturer=Toyota`), which then updates the URL and triggers a new data fetch. This creates an interactive filtering experience where charts become navigation controls.
