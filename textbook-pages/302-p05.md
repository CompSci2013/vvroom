## Common Problems

| Symptom | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| `NullInjectorError: No provider for HttpClient` | HttpClientModule not imported | Add HttpClientModule to app.module.ts imports |
| `Cannot find module '../models/api-response.interface'` | Interface file missing | Create it in Section 206 first |
| CORS errors in browser | API doesn't allow cross-origin | Configure API server or use proxy |
| `Type 'Observable<Object>' is not assignable to...` | Generic type mismatch | Ensure response type matches expected type |
| Arrays serialized as `[object Object]` | Nested objects in params | Flatten objects before passing to params |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Thin wrappers reduce boilerplate** — ApiService handles serialization and errors so each call site doesn't have to
2. **Arrays serialize as comma-separated values** — This matches common REST API conventions
3. **Error handling transforms, doesn't swallow** — Errors are logged and re-thrown for upstream handling

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `src/app/framework/services/api.service.ts` exists with complete implementation
- [ ] Barrel file exports the service
- [ ] Service is `@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })`
- [ ] `get<T>()` method returns typed Observable
- [ ] `post<T>()`, `put<T>()`, `patch<T>()`, `delete<T>()` methods implemented
- [ ] `getStandard<T>()` unwraps success/error envelope responses
- [ ] `buildHttpParams()` correctly serializes arrays as comma-separated
- [ ] `handleError()` transforms errors consistently
- [ ] HttpClientModule is imported in app.module.ts
- [ ] TypeScript compilation succeeds
- [ ] JSDoc comments document all public methods

## Next Step

Proceed to `303-request-coordinator.md` to create the service that coordinates API requests with caching and deduplication.
