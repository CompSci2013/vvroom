### Step 605.2: Understand the Highlight Filter Structure

Highlight filters use the same structure as query control filters with one key difference: the `urlParams` values have the `h_` prefix.

**Query Control Filter:**
```typescript
{
  field: 'manufacturer',
  urlParams: 'manufacturer'  // URL: ?manufacturer=Ford
}
```

**Highlight Filter:**
```typescript
{
  field: 'manufacturer',
  urlParams: 'h_manufacturer'  // URL: ?h_manufacturer=Ford
}
```

The `h_` prefix signals to the API adapter that this is a highlight filter, not a regular filter.

### Step 605.3: Understanding the URL Parameter Convention

The `h_` prefix is a convention used throughout the application:

| Regular Filter | Highlight Filter | Effect |
|----------------|------------------|--------|
| `manufacturer=Ford` | `h_manufacturer=Ford` | Filter: Only Ford | Highlight: All data, Ford colored |
| `yearMin=2020&yearMax=2023` | `h_yearMin=2020&h_yearMax=2023` | Filter: Only 2020-2023 | Highlight: All years, 2020-2023 colored |
| `bodyClass=SUV` | `h_bodyClass=SUV` | Filter: Only SUVs | Highlight: All body classes, SUV colored |

**Combined example:**
```
?manufacturer=Ford&h_bodyClass=SUV

Result:
- Data filtered to Ford vehicles only
- Charts show all Ford body classes
- SUV bars highlighted in orange, other Ford body classes in blue
```
