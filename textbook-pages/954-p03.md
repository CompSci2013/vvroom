## URL-First Architecture Terms

### Adapter
A class that converts between framework types and domain-specific types. Examples: `AutomobileUrlMapper`, `AutomobileApiAdapter`.

### API Adapter
An adapter that handles API communication for a specific domain. Implements `IApiAdapter<TFilters, TData, TStatistics>`.

### Cache Key Builder
A class that generates unique cache keys from filter objects. Ensures API responses are cached correctly.

### Chart Data Source
A class that transforms domain statistics into chart-ready data (Plotly traces). Each chart type has its own data source.

### Domain
A specific area of functionality in the application. In vvroom, "automobile" is the domain. Other books might add "agriculture" or "real estate".

### Domain Config
The central configuration object for a domain. Contains adapters, UI configs, and type references. Type: `DomainConfig<TFilters, TData, TStatistics>`.

### Domain Config Registry
A service that stores and retrieves domain configurations. Allows framework code to access the active domain's config.

### Filter
A set of criteria that narrow search results. In vvroom: manufacturer, model, year, body class, etc.

### Framework Code
Domain-agnostic code that works with any domain through interfaces. Located in `src/app/framework/`.

### Highlight
A visual emphasis on data that matches specific criteria. Highlights don't filter data; they color-code matching items.

### Pop-out Window
A separate browser window displaying part of the application. Communicates with the main window via `postMessage`.

### Resource Management Service
The central service managing data fetching, caching, and state. Coordinates URL state with API calls.
