# 608: Domain Providers

**Status:** Planning
**Depends On:** 607-domain-config-assembly
**Blocks:** 906-app-config

## Learning Objectives

After completing this section, you will:
- Understand the purpose of a domain providers registry
- Know how to add new domains to the application
- Recognize the pattern of collecting providers from multiple sources

---

## Objective

Create the domain providers file that exports an array of all domain configuration providers. This is the single point where all domains are registered for the application.

---

## Why

The vvroom application is designed to support multiple domains. While we only have automobiles now, the architecture anticipates:

- Agriculture (crops, yields, regions)
- Chemistry (compounds, reactions)
- Physics (particles, experiments)
- Finance (stocks, portfolios)

Each domain has its own `DOMAIN_PROVIDER`. The domain providers file collects them all:

```typescript
// Without domain providers registry
@NgModule({
  providers: [
    automobileDomainProvider,
    agricultureDomainProvider,
    chemistryDomainProvider,
    // ... manually list each one
  ]
})
```

```typescript
// With domain providers registry
import { DOMAIN_PROVIDERS } from '../domain-config/domain-providers';

@NgModule({
  providers: [
    ...DOMAIN_PROVIDERS  // Spread all domain providers
  ]
})
```

Benefits:
1. **Single source of truth** — All domains listed in one file
2. **Easy to add domains** — Add one line to add a new domain
3. **Clear inventory** — Easy to see what domains exist

### For Vvroom (Automobile Only)

Since vvroom only has automobiles, the domain providers file is simple. But the pattern prepares for future expansion.

## What

### Step 608.1: Create the Domain Providers File

Create the file that exports all domain providers.

Create `src/app/domain-config/domain-providers.ts`:

```typescript
// src/app/domain-config/domain-providers.ts

import { Provider } from '@angular/core';
import { DOMAIN_PROVIDER as automobileDomainProvider } from './automobile';

/**
 * Array of all domain configuration providers.
 *
 * Each domain should export a `DOMAIN_PROVIDER` that can be added to this array.
 * This allows for dynamic registration of domains at application startup.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Add a new domain
 * import { DOMAIN_PROVIDER as newDomainProvider } from './new-domain';
 *
 * export const DOMAIN_PROVIDERS: Provider[] = [
 *   automobileDomainProvider,
 *   newDomainProvider
 * ];
 * ```
 */
export const DOMAIN_PROVIDERS: Provider[] = [
  automobileDomainProvider,
];
```
