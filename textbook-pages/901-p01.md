# 901: Home Component

**Status:** Planning
**Depends On:** 102-app-shell, 103-routing
**Blocks:** 907-final-integration

---

## Learning Objectives

After completing this section, you will:
- Understand how to create a landing page component that serves as a domain hub
- Know how to use Angular's `RouterModule` for in-app navigation links
- Be able to apply CSS Grid to create responsive card layouts

---

## Objective

Build the Home component — the application's main entry point that welcomes users and provides navigation to the automobile discovery features. This component establishes the visual identity of vvroom and guides users to explore automobile data.

---

## Why

Every application needs a home base. The Home component serves several critical purposes:

1. **First Impression** — Users land here first; it sets expectations for the entire application
2. **Navigation Hub** — Provides clear pathways to key features without overwhelming users
3. **Domain Introduction** — Explains what the application does before diving into specifics

### Angular Style Guide References

- [Style 02-01](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide#style-02-01): Use consistent naming conventions (`home.component.ts`)
- [Style 04-07](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide#style-04-07): Create a folder for each feature component

### Design Principles

The Home component is intentionally simple. It contains no business logic, no API calls, and no complex state management. It's pure presentation:

- Static content
- Navigation links
- Visual styling

This simplicity is deliberate. The Home component should load instantly and never fail. It's the fallback when something goes wrong elsewhere.

## What

### Step 901.1: Create the Home Component Directory

First, ensure the home feature directory exists:

```bash
$ cd ~/projects/vvroom
$ mkdir -p src/app/features/home
```

---

### Step 901.2: Create the Home Component

Create `src/app/features/home/home.component.ts`:

```typescript
// src/app/features/home/home.component.ts
// VERSION 1 (Section 901) - Complete home component with navigation

import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { RouterModule } from '@angular/router';
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';

/**
 * Home Component - Landing Page
 *
 * Serves as the main entry point for the vvroom application.
 * Provides navigation to the automobile discovery features.
 *
 * This component is intentionally simple - pure presentation
 * with no business logic or state management.
 */
@Component({
  selector: 'app-home',
  templateUrl: './home.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./home.component.scss']
})
export class HomeComponent {}
```

**What this code does:**

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `selector: 'app-home'` | The HTML tag used to render this component |
| `templateUrl` | External HTML file for better separation of concerns |
| `styleUrls` | External SCSS file for component-specific styles |
| Empty class body | No logic needed — this is pure presentation |
