## Learning Objectives

After completing this section, you will:
- Understand how to bind a data table to reactive streams from a service
- Know how to implement server-side pagination and sorting via URL state
- Be able to create expandable row details using PrimeNG Table templates

---

## Objective

Build a configuration-driven results table component that displays data from `ResourceManagementService`, supports server-side pagination and sorting, and shows expandable row details. This component is the primary way users view search results in the discover interface.

---

## Why

The results table is the heart of any data discovery application. Users search, filter, and browse results in this table. However, different domains have different columns and data structures. The **Basic Results Table** solves this by:

1. Reading column definitions from `DomainConfig.tableConfig`
2. Binding to reactive streams (`results$`, `loading$`, `totalResults$`) from `ResourceManagementService`
3. Emitting pagination and sort changes that update URL state

This keeps the component domain-agnostic while still providing rich functionality.

### Angular Style Guide References

- [Style 05-02](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide#style-05-02): Use input properties for data binding
- [Style 05-15](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide#style-05-15): Provide a selector prefix

### URL-First Architecture Reference

When users click pagination controls or column headers to sort, the table emits events that ultimately update URL parameters. The `ResourceManagementService` watches these URL changes and triggers new API requests. This maintains our URL-First principle: the URL is the single source of truth.
