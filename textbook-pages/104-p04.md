## Verification

All verification is covered in Step 104.6. If any test fails, review the relevant section:

| Failed Test | Review Section |
|-------------|----------------|
| Root redirect | 103, Step 103.4 (routes) |
| Navigation reloads page | 103, Step 103.6 (routerLink) |
| Active link not highlighted | 103, Step 103.6 (routerLinkActive) |
| Browser history broken | 103, Step 103.5 (AppRoutingModule) |
| Direct URL access fails | 103, Step 103.4 (routes) |
| Build errors | 101, 102, 103 (various) |

## Common Problems

| Symptom | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Build fails with environment error | `apiBaseUrl` not added to environment files | Update both environment files per Step 104.1 |
| Missing directories | Section 101 steps skipped | Run mkdir commands from Section 101 |
| Component files missing | Section 103 steps skipped | Create components per Section 103 |
| Tests pass locally but not described here | You're ahead of the manuscript | Great! Continue to the next section |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Environment files are build-time configuration** — Values are baked into the bundle, not loaded at runtime
2. **Checkpoints prevent cascading errors** — Verify the foundation before building on it
3. **Phase 1 establishes the routing skeleton** — All URL-First state management builds on this foundation
