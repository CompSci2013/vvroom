## RxJS Terms

### BehaviorSubject
A Subject that requires an initial value and emits the current value to new subscribers. Used for state that always has a value.

### combineLatest
An operator that combines the latest values from multiple observables. Emits whenever any source emits (after all have emitted at least once).

### distinctUntilChanged
An operator that only emits when the current value differs from the previous value. Prevents duplicate emissions.

### filter
An operator that emits only values that pass a predicate function.

### map
An operator that transforms each emitted value using a projection function.

### Observable
A lazy push collection that can emit zero or more values over time. Must be subscribed to for values to flow.

### Operator
A function that transforms an observable stream. Applied via the `pipe()` method. Examples: `map`, `filter`, `switchMap`.

### pipe
A method that chains operators together. `source$.pipe(op1, op2, op3)` applies operators in sequence.

### ReplaySubject
A Subject that replays a specified number of previous values to new subscribers. Useful for late subscribers.

### shareReplay
An operator that multicasts an observable and replays the last N values to new subscribers. Prevents duplicate API calls.

### Subject
An observable that is also an observer. Can push values with `next()` and be subscribed to.

### subscribe
The method that activates an observable and receives its values. Returns a Subscription that should be cleaned up.

### Subscription
An object representing the execution of an observable. Call `unsubscribe()` to stop receiving values and prevent memory leaks.
