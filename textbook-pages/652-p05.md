## Key Takeaways

1. **Time data requires chronological sorting** — Unlike counts, years have an inherent order that users expect
2. **Range selections need special handling** — Convert multi-point selections into min/max pairs
3. **URL parameters can be polymorphic** — The same method produces single or multi-parameter outputs based on input

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] File exists at `src/app/domain-config/automobile/chart-sources/year-chart-source.ts`
- [ ] Class `YearChartDataSource` extends `ChartDataSource<VehicleStatistics>`
- [ ] Years are sorted chronologically (ascending) in the chart
- [ ] X-axis uses category type for discrete year labels
- [ ] `handleClick` returns single year or `min|max` format for ranges
- [ ] `toUrlParams` handles both single year and range formats
- [ ] Highlight mode produces `h_year`, `h_yearMin`, `h_yearMax` parameters
- [ ] Code compiles without TypeScript errors (after dependencies are created)
