### Step 104.2: Understand Build-Time File Replacement

Angular's build system replaces environment files at build time. This is configured in `angular.json`:

```json
"configurations": {
  "production": {
    "fileReplacements": [
      {
        "replace": "src/environments/environment.ts",
        "with": "src/environments/environment.prod.ts"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

When you run `ng build --configuration=production`, Angular swaps `environment.ts` for `environment.prod.ts`. Your code always imports from `environment.ts`, but the actual values come from the appropriate file.

**This is not runtime configuration.** The values are baked into the compiled JavaScript bundle. To change the API URL, you must rebuild.

### Step 104.3: Verify Project Structure

Run the following command to confirm the directory structure from Section 101:

```bash
$ cd ~/projects/vvroom
$ find src/app -type d | sort
```

Expected output:

```
src/app
src/app/domain-config
src/app/domain-config/automobile
src/app/domain-config/automobile/adapters
src/app/domain-config/automobile/chart-sources
src/app/domain-config/automobile/configs
src/app/domain-config/automobile/models
src/app/features
src/app/features/discover
src/app/features/home
src/app/features/popout
src/app/framework
src/app/framework/components
src/app/framework/models
src/app/framework/services
src/app/framework/tokens
```

If directories are missing, create them using the commands from Section 101.

### Step 104.4: Verify Component Files

Confirm the feature components from Section 103 exist:

```bash
$ ls -la src/app/features/*/
```

Expected output:

```
src/app/features/discover/:
discover.component.ts

src/app/features/home/:
home.component.ts

src/app/features/popout/:
popout.component.ts
```

### Step 104.5: Build and Serve

Run the build to confirm everything compiles:

```bash
$ cd ~/projects/vvroom
$ ng build
```

Expected: Build succeeds with no errors.

Start the development server:

```bash
$ ng serve
```

Open your browser to `http://localhost:4200`.
