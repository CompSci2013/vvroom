### 2. Serve the Application

```bash
$ ng serve --open
```

Browser opens to `http://localhost:4200`

### 3. Verify Redirect

When you first load `http://localhost:4200`, you should be redirected to `http://localhost:4200/home`. Check the URL bar — it should show `/home`, not just `/`.

### 4. Test Navigation

Click "Discover" in the navigation:
- URL changes to `http://localhost:4200/discover`
- Page does NOT reload (no white flash)
- Content area shows "Discover Vehicles" heading
- "Discover" link is highlighted (slightly brighter background)

Click "Home":
- URL changes to `http://localhost:4200/home`
- Content shows "Welcome to Vvroom"
- "Home" link is highlighted

### 5. Test Browser History

1. Navigate to Home
2. Navigate to Discover
3. Click the browser's back button

Expected: You return to Home without a page reload. The URL updates and the content changes instantly.

### 6. Test Direct URL Access

Open a new browser tab and navigate directly to:
- `http://localhost:4200/discover`

Expected: The Discover page loads directly, with the navigation showing Discover as active.

### 7. Test Popout Route

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/popout` by typing it in the address bar:

Expected: The Popout placeholder component renders.

### 8. Inspect Active Link Styling

Open browser developer tools (F12), navigate to Home, and inspect the Home link:

```html
<a class="nav-link nav-link-active" ...>Home</a>
```

The `nav-link-active` class should be present.

## Common Problems

| Symptom | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| `ng build` fails with "Cannot find module './features/home/home.component'" | Component file not created or wrong path | Verify file exists at `src/app/features/home/home.component.ts` |
| "Error: No component factory found for HomeComponent" | Component not declared in AppModule | Add `HomeComponent` to the `declarations` array |
| Links still cause full page reload | Still using `href` instead of `routerLink` | Replace `href="/home"` with `routerLink="/home"` |
| "Error: Cannot find primary outlet to load 'HomeComponent'" | Missing `<router-outlet>` in template | Add `<router-outlet></router-outlet>` to AppComponent template |
| Active link style not showing | Typo in `routerLinkActive` class name | Ensure the class name matches: `routerLinkActive="nav-link-active"` and `.nav-link-active` in styles |
| Navigating to `/` shows blank content | Redirect not working | Ensure route has `pathMatch: 'full'` on the redirect |
| "NullInjectorError: No provider for Router" | `AppRoutingModule` not imported | Add `AppRoutingModule` to the `imports` array in `AppModule` |
