## Verification

### 1. Build the Application

```bash
$ cd ~/projects/vvroom
$ ng build
```

Expected: Build succeeds with no errors.

### 2. Check TypeScript Compilation

```bash
$ npx tsc --noEmit
```

Expected: No type errors.

### 3. Verify PrimeNG Chip Import

```bash
$ grep "ChipModule" src/app/framework/framework.module.ts
```

Expected: `ChipModule` is in imports array.

### 4. Manual Inspection

Check `src/app/framework/components/inline-filters/inline-filters.component.ts`:
- Subscribes to `urlState.params$`
- Builds chips from URL parameters
- Emits events for remove/edit/clear all

---

## Common Problems

| Symptom | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Chips not showing | URL params not matching filter definitions | Verify `urlParams` in filter definitions match actual URL param names |
| Remove button doesn't work | Event propagation | Verify `event.stopPropagation()` is called in `onChipRemove` |
| Chip click and remove both fire | Missing stop propagation | Add `event.stopPropagation()` to remove handler |
| Highlights not distinguishable | Same styling as filters | Verify `.highlight-chip` has different background color |
| Chips wrap incorrectly | Missing `flex-wrap` | Ensure container has `flex-wrap: wrap` |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Chips provide compact filter visibility** - Users see active filters at a glance
2. **Events enable parent coordination** - The component doesn't modify URL directly; it emits events
3. **Separate filter and highlight sections** - Different visual treatment for different purposes
