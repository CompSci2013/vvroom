#### Query Control Tests

| Test | Expected Result | Pass? |
|------|-----------------|-------|
| Dropdown filter works | Options load, selection applies | [ ] |
| Text search works | Search executes on enter | [ ] |
| Clear individual filter | Only that filter removed | [ ] |
| Clear all filters | All filters removed | [ ] |
| Filter chips display | Active filters shown | [ ] |

#### Error Handling Tests

| Test | Expected Result | Pass? |
|------|-----------------|-------|
| API error occurs | Error notification shown | [ ] |
| Network timeout | Graceful error message | [ ] |
| Invalid filter value | Validation feedback | [ ] |
| 404 route | Redirects to home | [ ] |

### Step 907.4: Performance Verification

Check application performance:

```bash
# Development server
$ ng serve

# In another terminal, run Lighthouse or similar tool
# Or manually check DevTools Performance tab
```

Performance targets:
- First Contentful Paint: < 1.5s
- Time to Interactive: < 3s
- Largest Contentful Paint: < 2.5s
- No layout shifts during load

### Step 907.5: Code Quality Check

Run linting and formatting:

```bash
$ ng lint
```

Expected: No errors. (Warnings acceptable for rough draft.)

### Step 907.6: Final Review of Key Patterns

Let's summarize the key architectural patterns used throughout the application:

#### URL-First State Management

```
URL (source of truth)
    ↓
UrlStateService (URL → Params)
    ↓
ResourceManagementService (Params → Filters → API)
    ↓
Components (via async pipe)
```

Every piece of state is derived from the URL. This enables:
- Deep linking
- Browser history support
- State sharing via URL
- Debuggability

#### Dependency Injection Hierarchy

```
AppModule (global providers)
    ↓
Feature Module (lazy-loaded)
    ↓
Component (component-level providers)
    ↓
Template (via async pipe)
```

Services are provided at the appropriate level:
- Singletons at root
- Per-page instances at component level

#### Component Composition

```
Feature Component (orchestrator)
    ├── Framework Component (reusable)
    │   └── Domain Config (configuration)
    └── Framework Component (reusable)
        └── Domain Config (configuration)
```

Framework components are reusable shells. Domain configuration provides the specifics.
