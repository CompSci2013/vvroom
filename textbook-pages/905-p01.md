## Learning Objectives

After completing this section, you will:
- Understand how to configure Angular Router with lazy loading for feature modules
- Know how to structure routes with nested children for complex navigation
- Be able to implement route guards and redirects for improved UX

---

## Objective

Configure the application's routing module to connect all feature components into a cohesive, navigable application. This is where the individual pieces we've built come together as a unified experience.

---

## Why

The routing module is the skeleton of your application. It defines:

1. **Navigation Paths** — What URLs map to which components
2. **Loading Strategy** — Which features load immediately vs. on demand
3. **User Experience** — Default routes, redirects, and error handling

### Angular Router Key Concepts

| Concept | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `Routes` | Array of route configurations |
| `RouterModule.forRoot()` | Configures router at application level |
| `loadChildren` | Lazy-loads a feature module on navigation |
| `redirectTo` | Redirects one path to another |
| `pathMatch` | Determines how path is matched ('full' or 'prefix') |

### Angular Style Guide References

- [Style 04-10](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide#style-04-10): Use redirects for default routes
- [Style 04-11](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide#style-04-11): Consider lazy loading for large features

### URL-First Architecture

The router is central to URL-First architecture. Every view in the application corresponds to a URL, and the URL is the source of truth for application state. The routing module defines what those URLs are.
