**Depends On:** 808-statistics-panel-2, 801-base-chart-component
**Blocks:** 903-discover-page-component

## Learning Objectives

After completing this section, you will:
- Understand how to integrate Dockview with Angular components
- Know how to move Angular-rendered elements into Dockview panels via DOM manipulation
- Be able to create tabbed, resizable panel layouts for data visualization

---

## Objective

Build a statistics panel component that renders charts inside Dockview containers with tabbed, resizable, and draggable panels. This provides an alternative layout to the CDK grid, allowing users to arrange charts in a more flexible workspace.

---

## Why

Different users prefer different layouts for data exploration:

1. **Fixed grid** (StatisticsPanel2) — Simple, predictable, two columns
2. **Dockable panels** (DockviewStatisticsPanel) — Flexible, tabbed, resizable

Dockview provides:
- **Tabbed panels** — Multiple charts in the same space, switch via tabs
- **Resizable splits** — Drag borders to adjust chart sizes
- **Drag to rearrange** — Drag tabs to reorder or split panels
- **Consistent dark theme** — Matches the application's visual style

### Why Dockview Instead of Building Custom Panels?

Building a full-featured docking system is complex:
- Tab management with close/reorder
- Resizable split panes
- Drop zones for drag operations
- Serialization/restoration of layouts

Dockview provides all of this out of the box. We integrate it with Angular via a DOM manipulation pattern.

### The DOM Manipulation Pattern

Dockview is framework-agnostic and expects to manage its own DOM. Angular components, however, are rendered by Angular's change detection. The pattern:

1. Render Angular chart components in a hidden container
2. When Dockview creates a panel, move the chart element into the panel
3. When Dockview disposes a panel, move the chart back to the hidden container

This keeps Angular happy while letting Dockview manage the layout.
