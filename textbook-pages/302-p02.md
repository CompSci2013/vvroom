### Why Not More Abstraction?

You might wonder: *Why not build a full data layer with repositories, unit of work, etc.?*

The answer is **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**. The vvroom application:
- Reads data from a REST API
- Displays it in tables and charts
- Filters via URL parameters

A thin HTTP wrapper is all we need. Adding more abstraction would increase complexity without benefit.

### Error Handling Strategy

`ApiService` catches errors and transforms them into consistent Error objects. It does NOT:
- Show UI notifications (that's the component's job)
- Retry failed requests (that's `RequestCoordinator`'s job)
- Log to external services (that's the error handler's job)

Each layer has its responsibility.
