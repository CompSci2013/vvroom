# 000: Book Conventions

**Document Type:** Meta
**Purpose:** Establish the style and structure for all textbook documents in this series

---

## Overview

This `textbook/` directory contains the manuscript for a comprehensive Angular 13 programming book. The book follows the style of Apress technical publications, with a focus on learning-by-doing through the incremental construction of a real application: **vvroom**, an automobile discovery platform.

The application implements the **URL-First State Management** pattern, documented in `docs/`.

## Target Audience

A junior developer who will:
- Type every line of code shown
- Understand why each decision was made
- Have a working, testable application at every checkpoint

---

## Document Structure

Each numbered document (`001-*.md`, `002-*.md`, etc.) represents a chapter or major section. Every document follows this structure:

### 1. Header Block

```markdown
# NNN: Title

**Status:** Planning | In Progress | Complete
**Depends On:** List of prerequisite document numbers
**Blocks:** List of documents that depend on this one
```

### 2. Objective

A single paragraph stating what this section accomplishes.

### 3. Why (Rationale)

- Explain the reasoning behind the approach
- Reference industry standards:
  - Angular Style Guide (https://angular.io/guide/styleguide)
  - URL-First pattern (see `docs/README.md`)
  - TypeScript best practices
  - RxJS patterns
- Cite specific rules when applicable (e.g., "Style 04-10: Use redirects for default routes")

### 4. What (Implementation)

Step-by-step instructions with:
- **Full absolute paths** for every file (e.g., `src/app/features/home/home.component.ts`)
- **Complete file contents** — no ellipses, no "add similar code"
- **Every import statement** — never assume the reader knows what to import
- **Terminal commands** with expected output where applicable

### 5. Verification

- How to confirm the step worked
- What to see in the browser
- What to see in the console
- Any tests to run
