## Key Takeaways

1. **Feature components orchestrate, not implement** — They wire together framework components
2. **Component-level providers create isolated instances** — `ResourceManagementService` is fresh for each Discover instance
3. **The async pipe is your friend** — It handles subscription management automatically

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `AutomobileDiscoverComponent` is created with proper providers
- [ ] Component template renders all panel types (query control, charts, table, picker)
- [ ] Panels can be collapsed and expanded
- [ ] Pop-out placeholder is shown when a panel is popped out
- [ ] Results count updates reactively from `ResourceManagementService`
- [ ] All child component inputs are properly bound
- [ ] Event handlers update URL state through `UrlStateService`
- [ ] `ng build` completes without errors

## Architecture Note: The Flow of Data

The Discover component demonstrates the complete URL-First data flow:

```
User Action (click filter)
    ↓
Event Handler (onUrlParamsChange)
    ↓
UrlStateService.setParams()
    ↓
URL Updates (browser address bar)
    ↓
ResourceManagementService watches URL
    ↓
Filters extracted → API call made
    ↓
Response updates BehaviorSubject
    ↓
Components receive new data via async pipe
    ↓
UI updates automatically
```

Every piece of state flows through the URL. This is the "Aha moment" of Phase 9: you've built an application where the URL is the single source of truth, and every component reacts to URL changes.
