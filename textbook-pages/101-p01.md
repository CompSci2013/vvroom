# 101: Project Cleanup

**Status:** Planning
**Depends On:** 000-book-conventions, 051-api-contract-overview
**Blocks:** 102-app-shell

## Learning Objectives

After completing this section, you will:
- Understand why removing boilerplate establishes ownership of your codebase
- Know how Angular environment files enable configuration without code changes
- Recognize the directory structure that separates framework code from domain code

---

## Objective

Remove Angular CLI boilerplate and establish the directory structure that will support our URL-First architecture. After this section, you will have a clean foundation ready for building the vvroom application.

---

## Why

When you generate a new Angular project with `ng new`, the CLI creates placeholder content designed to help newcomers verify their setup works. This placeholder content includes:

- A welcome message with the Angular logo
- Links to Angular documentation
- Sample text that has nothing to do with your application

**This is noise.** Every line of code in your project should serve a purpose. Removing boilerplate immediately establishes a professional mindset: you own every line of code in this project, and you understand why it's there.

Additionally, we need to:

1. **Configure the environment** — Set the API base URL so our services know where to fetch data
2. **Establish the directory structure** — Create folders that match our architecture before we need them
3. **Update the HTML title** — Small detail, but professionalism shows in the details

## What

### Step 101.1: Understand the Current State

Before making changes, examine what the Angular CLI generated. Open a terminal and navigate to your project:

```bash
$ cd ~/projects/vvroom
$ ls -la src/app/
```

You should see:

```
total 16
drwxr-xr-x 2 user user 4096 Feb  9 10:00 .
drwxr-xr-x 5 user user 4096 Feb  9 10:00 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 1234 Feb  9 10:00 app.component.ts
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user  345 Feb  9 10:00 app.module.ts
```

The current `src/app/app.component.ts` contains placeholder content with an inline template showing a welcome message, the Angular logo, and documentation links. This is what we'll clean up.
