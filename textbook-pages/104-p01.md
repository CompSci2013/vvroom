# 104: Environment Config Verification

**Status:** Planning
**Depends On:** 103-routing
**Blocks:** 150-typescript-generics-primer

---

## Learning Objectives

After completing this section, you will:
- Understand how Angular's environment files enable build-time configuration
- Know how to verify your project compiles and runs correctly
- Recognize that Phase 1 establishes the foundation for all subsequent work

---

## Objective

Verify the environment configuration from Section 101 and confirm the Phase 1 foundation is complete. This section is a consolidation checkpoint — ensuring everything from Sections 101-103 works together before proceeding to framework development.

---

## Why

### Checkpoints Prevent Cascading Errors

Before building framework services and components, we must confirm the foundation is solid. A misconfigured environment or broken route will cause confusing errors later. It's easier to diagnose problems in isolation than to debug a broken service that depends on three other broken things.

### The Phase 1 Checkpoint

Document 002 (Dissection Rubric) defines this checkpoint:

> **Phase 1 Checkpoint:** Navigation between empty pages works. Browser history works. Readers observe URL changes in dev tools.

This section verifies we've achieved that checkpoint.

## What

### Step 104.1: Verify Environment Files

The environment files should already exist from Section 101. Confirm their contents.

Open `src/environments/environment.ts` and verify it contains:

```typescript
// src/environments/environment.ts

export const environment = {
  production: false,
  apiBaseUrl: 'http://generic-prime.minilab/api/specs/v1'
};
```

Open `src/environments/environment.prod.ts` and verify it contains:

```typescript
// src/environments/environment.prod.ts

export const environment = {
  production: true,
  apiBaseUrl: 'http://generic-prime.minilab/api/specs/v1'
};
```

If these files don't match, update them now. The `apiBaseUrl` property will be used by services in Phase 3.
