## Verification

### 1. Build the Application

```bash
$ ng build
```

Expected: Build succeeds with no errors.

### 2. Serve the Application

```bash
$ ng serve
```

Expected: Application starts without errors. Console should show:

```
✔ Compiled successfully.
```

### 3. Check Provider Registration

Open browser DevTools and verify:

1. **HTTP Interceptor:** Make a request and check Network tab. Errors should be handled gracefully.

2. **Global Error Handler:** In console, run:
   ```javascript
   throw new Error('Test error');
   ```
   The error should be caught by `GlobalErrorHandler`.

3. **Domain Config:** Components should receive domain configuration. If the discover page loads and shows data, the config is working.

### 4. Verify Lazy Loading

In the Network tab, observe chunk files loading:
- Initial load: `main.js`, `vendor.js`, `polyfills.js`
- Navigate to `/automobiles`: `automobile-module.js` loads
- Navigate to `/automobiles/discover`: No new chunk (same module)

### 5. Full Application Test

Complete this workflow:
1. Open `http://localhost:4200` → Redirects to `/home`
2. Click "Automobiles" → Navigates to automobile landing
3. Click "Advanced Search" → Navigates to discover page
4. Apply filters → Data loads, URL updates
5. Refresh page → Filters persist
6. Pop out a panel → New window opens with synced state
