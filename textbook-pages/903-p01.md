# 903: Discover Page Component

**Status:** Planning
**Depends On:** 902-automobile-landing-component, 306-resource-management-service, 801-809 (Framework Components)
**Blocks:** 907-final-integration

## Learning Objectives

After completing this section, you will:
- Understand how to orchestrate multiple framework components in a feature page
- Know how to use `ResourceManagementService` for URL-first state management
- Be able to implement drag-and-drop panel reordering with Angular CDK

---

## Objective

Build the Automobile Discover component — the main data exploration interface that combines all framework components (query control, charts, tables, pickers) into a cohesive discovery experience. This is where users spend most of their time: filtering data, viewing statistics, and exploring results.

---

## Why

The Discover component is the heart of vvroom. It demonstrates the power of the URL-First architecture by:

1. **Orchestrating Components** — Combines query panel, charts, tables, and pickers
2. **Managing State** — Uses `ResourceManagementService` with URL as single source of truth
3. **Enabling Workflows** — Supports pop-out windows for multi-monitor setups
4. **Providing Flexibility** — Allows users to reorder and collapse panels

### The Orchestrator Pattern

Feature components like Discover don't contain UI logic themselves. Instead, they:

```
Feature Component (Orchestrator)
    ├── Injects services (ResourceManagementService, DomainConfig)
    ├── Coordinates framework components
    ├── Handles cross-component communication
    └── Manages page-level concerns (panel order, collapse state)
```

Each framework component (QueryControl, BaseChart, DynamicResultsTable) is self-contained. The Discover component wires them together and handles their outputs.
