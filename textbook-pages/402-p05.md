## Key Takeaways

1. **Classes enable methods and transformation** — `getDisplayName()`, `getAge()`, etc.
2. **Handle both API naming conventions** — Check for `body_class` and `bodyClass`
3. **Type coercion is essential** — API sends strings, models need numbers
4. **Instance methods encapsulate logic** — Business rules live in the model
