### 4. Verify Directory Structure

```bash
$ find src/app -type d | wc -l
```

Expected: `16` (the app directory plus 15 subdirectories we created)

### 5. Check Environment Configuration

```bash
$ grep -r "apiBaseUrl" src/environments/
```

Expected output:

```
src/environments/environment.ts:  apiBaseUrl: 'http://generic-prime.minilab/api/specs/v1'
src/environments/environment.prod.ts:  apiBaseUrl: 'http://generic-prime.minilab/api/specs/v1'
```

## Common Problems

| Symptom | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| `ng build` fails with "Cannot find module '@angular/core'" | Node modules not installed | Run `npm install` in the project root |
| Browser shows blank page | Template syntax error in `app.component.ts` | Check for missing backticks or quotes in the template |
| "Vvroom" title instead of "Vvroom - Automobile Discovery" | Didn't save `index.html` | Save the file and refresh the browser |
| Directories not created | Typo in `mkdir` command | Re-run the commands carefully; use tab completion |
| `ng serve` shows "Port 4200 is already in use" | Another process using the port | Kill the other process or use `ng serve --port 4201` |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Own your code** — Remove boilerplate so every line serves a purpose you understand
2. **Environment files separate configuration from code** — Change URLs without changing TypeScript
3. **Directory structure reflects architecture** — Framework code in `framework/`, domain code in `domain-config/`
