## Phase 1 Complete

You have successfully completed Phase 1: Foundation. Your application now has:

| Capability | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Clean project structure | Ready for framework and domain code |
| Environment configuration | API URL configured for both dev and prod |
| App shell with navigation | Header, content area, flexbox layout |
| Angular Router | Routes for Home, Discover, Popout |
| SPA navigation | No page reloads when clicking links |
| Browser history integration | Back/forward buttons work |
| Active route highlighting | Visual feedback for current location |

### The Phase 1 Aha Moment

**Routes are the skeleton. The URL is where state lives.**

Right now, your URLs are simple paths: `/home`, `/discover`, `/popout`. In Phase 3, we'll add services that read and write query parameters:

```
/discover?make=Toyota&year=2023&bodyClass=SUV&page=2
```

Every filter selection, every page navigation, every user choice will be encoded in the URL. This is URL-First State Management — and Phase 1 established the routing skeleton that makes it possible.
