### Verification: Test the Pop-Out

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/discover`
2. Click the "Open Pop-Out Window" button
3. A new browser window opens showing the Popout component
4. The URL in the new window is `http://localhost:4200/popout`

**Key observation:** The pop-out window runs the same Angular application. It just happens to be displaying a different route in a separate window.

### Why This Matters

This simple demonstration reveals the core insight behind pop-out windows:

> **Pop-outs are not special. They're just routes rendered in separate windows.**

In Phase 3B (documents 307-308), we'll add services that enable the main window and pop-out windows to communicate. But the foundation is what you see here: `window.open()` pointing to a route in your application.

When you understand this, the complexity of pop-out panels dissolves. A "pop-out chart" is just:
1. A route that renders a chart component
2. Opened in a new window
3. With a service that syncs state between windows

Steps 1 and 2 are already working. Step 3 comes later.
