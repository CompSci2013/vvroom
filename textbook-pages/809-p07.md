## Verification

### 1. Build the Application

```bash
$ cd ~/projects/vvroom
$ ng build
```

Expected: Build succeeds with no errors.

### 2. Check Dockview Installation

```bash
$ npm list dockview-core
```

Expected: Shows dockview-core version installed.

### 3. Verify Global Styles

```bash
$ grep "dockview" angular.json
```

Expected: Shows `node_modules/dockview-core/dist/styles/dockview.css` in styles array.

### 4. Manual Inspection

Check the component template:
- `#dockviewContainer` is present
- `#chartElement` template references are correct
- `data-chart-id` attributes are bound

## Common Problems

| Symptom | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Dockview not rendering | Container has zero height | Add `min-height: 400px` to `.dockview-wrapper` |
| Charts not visible in panels | DOM elements not moved | Check `chartElementsMap` population in console |
| Tabs not styled | Global CSS not loaded | Verify `angular.json` styles array |
| TypeError on dispose | Element already removed | Check for null in dispose callback |
| Floating panels appearing | `disableFloatingGroups` not set | Verify Dockview options |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Dockview is framework-agnostic** — It manages DOM; we bridge to Angular via element moves
2. **Hidden container pattern** — Keeps Angular components alive while Dockview manages layout
3. **Disable floating groups** — Prevents conflicts with our custom PopOutManagerService
