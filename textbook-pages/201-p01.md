# 201: Domain Config Interface

**Status:** Planning
**Depends On:** 150-typescript-generics-primer
**Blocks:** 202-resource-management-interface, 304-domain-config-registry

## Learning Objectives

After completing this section, you will:
- Understand how a single interface can define the contract for an entire domain's behavior
- Know how TypeScript generics enable type-safe domain configurations
- Recognize the relationship between configuration interfaces and framework services

---

## Objective

Create the `DomainConfig` interface that serves as the central configuration schema for any domain in the vvroom application. This interface defines all adapters, UI configurations, and feature flags required for the framework to operate with domain-specific data.

---

## Why

The `DomainConfig` interface is the cornerstone of vvroom's architecture. It answers a critical question: *How do we make the framework work with any domain (automobiles, real estate, inventory) without changing framework code?*

The answer is **configuration-driven design**. Instead of hard-coding domain-specific behavior into services and components, we define a configuration interface that each domain must implement. The framework reads this configuration and adapts its behavior accordingly.

**This is the Phase 2 Aha Moment in action:** TypeScript interfaces are executable documentation. The `DomainConfig` interface documents *exactly* what any domain must provide to work with the framework. TypeScript enforces this contract at compile time.

### Benefits of Configuration-Driven Design

| Approach | Adding a New Domain Requires |
|----------|------------------------------|
| Hard-coded | Modifying framework services, components, routes |
| Configuration-driven | Creating one configuration file that implements DomainConfig |
