## Verification

### Final Build and Serve

```bash
$ ng build --configuration production
$ npx http-server dist/vvroom -p 8080
```

Open `http://localhost:8080` and verify:

1. Application loads without errors
2. All pages are accessible
3. Data loads correctly
4. Pop-outs work
5. URL state persists

### Commit the Final State

```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Section 907: Complete vvroom application"
$ git tag phase-9-complete
```

## What You've Built

### Application Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| TypeScript Files | ~70 |
| Lines of Code | ~11,000 |
| Components | ~15 |
| Services | ~12 |
| Interfaces | ~10 |
| Feature Modules | 3 |

### Capabilities

- **Data Exploration:** Filter, sort, and paginate through automobile data
- **Visualization:** Charts for manufacturers, years, body classes
- **Multi-Monitor:** Pop-out any panel to a separate window
- **URL Persistence:** Every view has a shareable URL
- **Error Handling:** Graceful error messages and recovery
- **Performance:** Lazy loading, OnPush change detection

### Technologies Used

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| Angular 13 | Application framework |
| TypeScript | Type-safe JavaScript |
| RxJS | Reactive state management |
| Angular Router | Navigation |
| HttpClient | API communication |
| BroadcastChannel | Pop-out communication |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Architecture matters** — The URL-First pattern made state management simple and predictable
2. **Generics enable reuse** — Framework components work with any domain configuration
3. **Separation of concerns** — Framework, domain, and feature code have clear boundaries
4. **TypeScript is your friend** — Type safety caught errors before runtime
5. **RxJS is powerful** — Reactive streams simplified complex async operations
