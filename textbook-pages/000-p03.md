## Reference Implementation

The **generic-prime** project (branch `angular/13`) serves as the canonical reference for all code in this book:

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Location | `~/projects/generic-prime` |
| Branch | `angular/13` |

When working on chapters:
1. Ensure generic-prime is on the `angular/13` branch
2. Copy relevant code files to vvroom
3. Adapt the textbook to accurately describe the copied code

To access the reference implementation:

```bash
cd ~/projects/generic-prime
git checkout angular/13
```

## Principles

1. **No magic** — Every line of code is explained or shown
2. **Compiles at every step** — The application must build and run after each section
3. **Why before what** — Rationale precedes implementation
4. **Full paths always** — Never ambiguous file references
5. **One concept per section** — Don't combine unrelated changes
6. **Test what you build** — Verification steps after every implementation
