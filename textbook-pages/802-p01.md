## Learning Objectives

After completing this section, you will:
- Understand the configuration-driven approach to building reusable UI components
- Know how to synchronize component state with URL parameters bidirectionally
- Be able to implement server-side pagination with selection persistence across pages

---

## Objective

Build a configuration-driven multi-select table component that wraps PrimeNG Table with selection management and URL synchronization. The picker loads data from an API, displays it in a paginated table, allows multi-row selection, and emits selected items for URL parameter updates.

---

## Why

Many data discovery applications need "picker" interfaces: tables where users select one or more items to filter results. For example, selecting specific vehicle models, manufacturers, or years.

Without a reusable picker component, each domain would require a custom implementation. The **Base Picker Component** eliminates this duplication by accepting configuration that describes:
- Which API endpoint to call
- Which columns to display
- How to serialize/deserialize selections to URL parameters

This is the Phase 8 pattern in action: **Generic components + specific configuration = infinite reusability**.

- [Style 03-01](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide#style-03-01): Use single responsibility principle
- [Style 05-04](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide#style-05-04): Put logic in the component class

### URL-First Architecture Reference

The picker maintains bidirectional sync with URL parameters:
1. **URL to Picker**: When URL contains selection parameters, the picker hydrates those selections
2. **Picker to URL**: When user clicks "Apply", the component emits a selection event that the parent uses to update the URL

This ensures selections survive page refreshes and are shareable via URL.
