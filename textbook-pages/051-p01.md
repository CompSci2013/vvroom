# 051: API Contract Overview

**Status:** Complete
**Depends On:** None
**Blocks:** 052, 053, all implementation phases

---

## Objective

Document the API contract that the vvroom application will consume. This includes base URL configuration, authentication requirements, pagination conventions, error formats, and general request/response patterns.

---

## Why

Before writing any code — models, services, or components — you must understand the shape of the data you're working with. The API contract is an **input** to the entire system:

- **Models** are defined by what the API returns
- **Adapters** translate between API responses and models
- **Services** call endpoints defined by the API
- **Components** display data shaped by the API

Without this document, developers would be guessing at data shapes, leading to runtime errors and constant refactoring.

## API Overview

### Base URL

| Environment | Base URL |
|-------------|----------|
| Development | `http://generic-prime.minilab/api/specs/v1` |
| Production | `http://generic-prime.minilab/api/specs/v1` |

The API is accessed via Traefik ingress on the Kubernetes cluster. The hostname `generic-prime.minilab` resolves to the cluster ingress controller.

### Authentication

**None required.** The API is accessible without authentication for this internal application.

### Content Type

All requests and responses use JSON:

```
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
```

---

## Pagination Convention

All list endpoints support pagination with these query parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `page` | number | 1 | Page number (1-indexed) |
| `size` | number | 20 | Items per page |

### Paginated Response Shape

```typescript
{
  "results": [...],      // Array of items for current page
  "total": 1234,         // Total items across all pages
  "page": 1,             // Current page number
  "size": 20,            // Items per page
  "totalPages": 62       // Total number of pages
}
```
