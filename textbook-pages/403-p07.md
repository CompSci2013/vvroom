## Phase 4 Complete

Congratulations! You have completed Phase 4: Domain Models.

**What you built:**
- Base model patterns with partial constructors
- `VehicleResult` and `VinInstance` data models
- `AutoSearchFilters` filter model
- `VehicleStatistics` and distribution stat models
- API response transformation for multiple formats

**The Aha Moment:**
"Domain models are more than data containers — they encapsulate transformation logic, business rules, and computed values."
