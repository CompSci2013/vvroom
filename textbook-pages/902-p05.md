### 4. Navigation Test

Click "Start Exploring →" on the Advanced Search card:
- URL should change to `/automobiles/discover`
- (The Discover component will be created in document 903)

## Common Problems

| Symptom | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Grid layout shows one column | Container too narrow | Check `max-width` on `.automobile-container` |
| Primary card not visually distinct | Missing `.feature-card-primary` class | Verify HTML has both `feature-card` and `feature-card-primary` classes |
| Hover effect not working | CSS transition not applied | Check that `.feature-card-primary` has `transition` property |
| Link not navigating | Route not configured | Routes will be set up in document 905 |
| Styles bleeding to other components | Missing component encapsulation | Ensure styles are in component-specific SCSS file |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Landing pages provide context** — They orient users before complex features
2. **Progressive disclosure reduces overwhelm** — Show features one level at a time
3. **Visual hierarchy guides attention** — Use borders, colors, and hover effects to indicate primary actions

## Architecture Note

The Automobile Landing component is the first **domain-specific feature component** we've built. Notice the pattern:

```
features/
├── home/                    # Application-level (no domain)
│   └── home.component.ts
└── automobile/              # Domain-specific
    └── automobile.component.ts
```

The `home` feature is domain-agnostic — it navigates to domains but contains no domain logic. The `automobile` feature is domain-specific — it lives entirely within the automobile context.

This separation matters because:
- Home component never changes when automobile features change
- Automobile module can be lazy-loaded independently
- Future domains (if any) follow the same pattern
