### 6. Inspect the DOM

Open browser developer tools (F12) and inspect the HTML:

```html
<app-root>
  <header class="app-header">...</header>
  <main class="app-content">...</main>
</app-root>
```

Notice there's no wrapper div — the `<app-root>` element itself is the flex container.

## Common Problems

| Symptom | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Header not full width | Missing `:host` styles | Ensure `:host { display: flex; }` is present |
| Content area doesn't fill viewport | Missing `min-height: 100vh` on `:host` | Add the missing style |
| Emoji not displaying | System font doesn't support emoji | This is rare; try a different browser |
| Styles not applying | Syntax error in `styles` array | Check for missing backticks or brackets |
| White gap at bottom of page | `flex: 1` not on `.app-content` | Add `flex: 1` to the content area |

## Key Takeaways

1. **The shell is the application frame** — It provides consistent structure across all pages
2. **`:host` styles the component element** — No wrapper divs needed
3. **`flex: 1` fills remaining space** — Combined with `min-height: 100vh`, creates full-viewport layouts

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `src/app/app.component.ts` contains the shell template with header and content area
- [ ] Header displays logo (🚗), title (vvroom), and navigation links (Home, Discover)
- [ ] Header has blue background (#1976d2) with white text
- [ ] Navigation links have hover effect
- [ ] Content area fills remaining viewport height
- [ ] `:host` selector is used for component-level layout
- [ ] `ng build` completes with no errors
- [ ] `ng serve` shows the shell correctly in the browser

## What We Accomplished

| Item | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| AppComponent template | Simple heading | Full shell with header and content |
| Layout | None | Flexbox-based full-height layout |
| Navigation | None | Placeholder links (non-functional) |
| Styling | None | Professional header with hover effects |
| Component pattern | Basic | Uses `:host` for layout |
