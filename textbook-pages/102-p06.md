## Architecture Note

The app shell follows the **container/presentational pattern**:

- **AppComponent (container)** — Provides structure and layout
- **Feature components (presentational)** — Render inside the content area

This separation means:
- Layout changes happen in one place (AppComponent)
- Feature components focus on their specific functionality
- The shell is framework code — it works for any domain
