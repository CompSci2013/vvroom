## TypeScript Terms

### Concrete Type
A specific, known type like `string`, `number`, or `AutomobileFilters`. Contrast with type parameters.

### Constraint
A limit on what types can be used as a type parameter. Syntax: `<T extends SomeInterface>`.

### Generic
A type or function that works with multiple types through type parameters. Provides type safety without code duplication.

### Interface
A TypeScript structure defining a contract for objects. Does not exist at runtime; only provides compile-time type checking.

### keyof
A TypeScript operator that returns a union of an object's property names as string literal types.

### Partial<T>
A utility type that makes all properties of T optional.

### Pick<T, K>
A utility type that creates a new type with only the specified properties from T.

### Record<K, V>
A utility type representing an object with keys of type K and values of type V.

### Type Guard
A function that narrows a type within a conditional block. Uses `is` return type syntax.

### Type Parameter
A placeholder type in a generic definition, filled in when the generic is used. Conventionally named `T`, `U`, or descriptively like `TFilters`.

### Union Type
A type that can be one of several types. Syntax: `string | number | null`.

### Utility Type
Built-in TypeScript types that transform other types. Examples: `Partial`, `Required`, `Pick`, `Omit`, `Record`.
