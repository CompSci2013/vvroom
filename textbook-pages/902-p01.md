## Learning Objectives

After completing this section, you will:
- Understand how to create a domain-specific landing page within a feature module
- Know how to provide context and navigation for a domain's features
- Be able to structure informational content that guides users to key functionality

---

## Objective

Build the Automobile Landing component — the entry point to the automobile domain that introduces users to available features and guides them toward the discovery interface. This component bridges the gap between the general Home page and the feature-rich Discover page.

---

## Why

When users click "Automobiles" from the Home page, they need orientation before diving into complex data exploration. The Automobile Landing component serves as this orientation layer:

1. **Domain Context** — Tells users what kind of data they'll explore
2. **Feature Preview** — Shows available capabilities before committing
3. **Clear Call-to-Action** — Guides users to the primary feature (Discover)
4. **Supporting Information** — Provides dataset stats and usage tips

### The Landing Page Pattern

Many successful applications use a two-level navigation pattern:

```
Home (all domains) → Domain Landing (one domain) → Feature Page (specific task)
```

This progressive disclosure prevents cognitive overload. Users make one decision at a time:
1. "I want to explore automobiles" (Home → Automobile Landing)
2. "I want to search and analyze data" (Landing → Discover)

### Angular Style Guide References

- [Style 04-07](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide#style-04-07): Feature areas should have their own folder
- [Style 02-01](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide#style-02-01): Name files with their feature name (`automobile`)
