### The Lazy-Loading Trick

The GlobalErrorHandler uses Angular's `Injector` to get the `ErrorNotificationService` instead of constructor injection:

```typescript
// Wrong - can cause circular dependency
constructor(private errorNotification: ErrorNotificationService) { }

// Right - lazy loading via injector
constructor(private injector: Injector) { }

private get errorNotificationService(): ErrorNotificationService {
  return this.injector.get(ErrorNotificationService);
}
```

This avoids circular dependency issues because:
1. ErrorHandler is created very early in Angular's bootstrap
2. ErrorNotificationService may depend on services not yet created
3. Lazy injection defers resolution until first use

### Chunk Load Errors

A special case is **chunk load errors** — when lazy-loaded modules fail to load:

```
Error: Loading chunk 5 failed.
```

These typically happen when:
- Network connection drops during navigation
- Server deployment changed chunk hashes
- Browser cache serves stale chunk

The handler shows a sticky message prompting the user to refresh.
