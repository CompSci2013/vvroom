## Phase 3A Complete

Congratulations! You have completed Phase 3A: Core Services.

**What you built:**
- UrlStateService — URL as source of truth
- ApiService — Thin HTTP wrapper
- RequestCoordinatorService — Cache, dedup, retry
- DomainConfigRegistry — Multi-domain support
- DomainConfigValidator — Runtime validation
- ResourceManagementService — State orchestration

**The Aha Moment:**
"The URL is the single source of truth. Components react to URL changes, they don't control them."
