## Verification

### 1. Build the Application

```bash
$ cd ~/projects/vvroom
$ ng build
```

Expected: Build succeeds with no errors.

### 2. Check TypeScript Compilation

```bash
$ npx tsc --noEmit
```

Expected: No type errors.

### 3. Verify All PrimeNG Imports

```bash
$ grep -E "DropdownModule|MultiSelectModule|AutoCompleteModule|CalendarModule" src/app/framework/framework.module.ts
```

Expected: All modules are in imports array.

### 4. Manual Inspection

Check `src/app/framework/components/query-panel/query-panel.component.html`:
- Each filter type has its own `*ngIf` block
- All inputs use `[(ngModel)]` for two-way binding
- Text inputs use `debounce: true` in `onFilterChange`

---

## Common Problems

| Symptom | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Filter controls not rendering | `filterDef.type` not matching template conditions | Verify filter type strings match exactly |
| Dropdown options empty | Dynamic options not loaded | Check `optionsEndpoint` in filter definition |
| Autocomplete not showing suggestions | API endpoint incorrect | Verify `autocompleteEndpoint` and API response format |
| Debounce not working | `searchSubject` not subscribed | Ensure constructor sets up debounce subscription |
| Clear button doesn't reset page | `page: 1` not included in update | Verify `applyFilterChange` includes page reset |

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Dynamic rendering from configuration** - One component handles all filter types
2. **Debounce improves performance** - Text inputs wait before triggering API calls
3. **Two-way binding with manual updates** - `ngModel` updates local state; `ngModelChange` triggers state management
