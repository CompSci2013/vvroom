## Learning Objectives

After completing this section, you will:
- Understand how Angular Router maps URLs to components
- Know how to use `routerLink` for navigation without full page reloads
- Be able to highlight the current route using `routerLinkActive`

---

## Objective

Configure Angular Router with routes for Home, Discover, and Popout pages. Replace the placeholder `href` links with Angular's `routerLink` directive so navigation updates the URL without reloading the page.

---

## Why

The URL is the foundation of our application's state management. Before we build any features, we need the routing skeleton in place. Here's why routing comes early:

### URLs Are State

In traditional web applications, the server generates each page. In a single-page application (SPA), the client handles navigation — but the URL remains the source of truth. When a user bookmarks `/discover?make=Toyota`, they expect to return to that exact view.

This is the core insight of **URL-First State Management**: the URL isn't just an address; it's a serialized representation of application state.

### Why Not Just Use `href`?

Standard HTML links (`<a href="/home">`) work, but they cause problems:

| `href` Behavior | Problem |
|-----------------|---------|
| Full page reload | Loses JavaScript state |
| Server request | Slower navigation |
| Flash of white | Poor user experience |

Angular's `routerLink` directive intercepts clicks and updates the URL without reloading. The Router then renders the appropriate component. This is faster, smoother, and preserves application state.

- [Style 04-10](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide#style-04-10): Use redirects for default routes
- [Style 02-05](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide#style-02-05): Suffix routing modules with `-routing`
