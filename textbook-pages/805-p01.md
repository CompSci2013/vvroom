## Learning Objectives

After completing this section, you will:
- Understand how to display active filters as interactive chips
- Know how to synchronize chip state with URL parameters
- Be able to implement click-to-edit and click-to-remove functionality

---

## Objective

Build a compact inline filters component that displays active filters as chips. Each chip shows the filter label and value(s), can be clicked to edit, and has a remove button. This component provides a non-intrusive way to show what filters are currently active.

---

## Why

Users need to see what filters are active without opening a panel. The **Inline Filters Component** provides:

1. **Visibility**: Users immediately see which filters are applied
2. **Quick removal**: One-click removal of any filter
3. **Edit access**: Click a chip to open the filter editor
4. **Compact display**: Uses minimal vertical space

This component complements the Query Panel (806) by showing the "output" of filter selections in a condensed format.

### Angular Style Guide References

- [Style 03-01](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide#style-03-01): Use single responsibility principle
- [Style 05-02](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide#style-05-02): Use input properties for data binding

### URL-First Architecture Reference

The inline filters component reads active filters from URL state (via `UrlStateService`) and displays them as chips. When a chip is removed, the component emits an event that clears the corresponding URL parameter. The component never stores filter state internally - it only reflects URL state.
