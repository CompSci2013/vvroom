## Key Takeaways

1. **Highlight filters segment, they don't filter** — All data remains; selected items are visually distinguished
2. **The h_ prefix is the convention** — URL parameters starting with h_ trigger highlight behavior
3. **Same structure, different purpose** — Highlight filters reuse the FilterDefinition interface with different urlParams
