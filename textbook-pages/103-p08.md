## Key Takeaways

1. **`routerLink` replaces `href`** — For SPA navigation without page reloads
2. **`<router-outlet>` is a placeholder** — Routed components render after it, not inside it
3. **`routerLinkActive` provides visual feedback** — Automatically adds a CSS class when the route matches

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `src/app/features/home/home.component.ts` exists with placeholder content
- [ ] `src/app/features/discover/discover.component.ts` exists with placeholder content
- [ ] `src/app/features/popout/popout.component.ts` exists with placeholder content
- [ ] `src/app/app-routing.module.ts` configures routes for home, discover, and popout
- [ ] Root path (`/`) redirects to `/home`
- [ ] `src/app/app.module.ts` declares all components and imports `AppRoutingModule`
- [ ] `AppComponent` uses `routerLink` instead of `href`
- [ ] `AppComponent` uses `routerLinkActive` for current route highlighting
- [ ] `AppComponent` includes `<router-outlet>` in the template
- [ ] Navigation works without page reload
- [ ] Browser back/forward buttons work correctly
- [ ] Active link has visual distinction (`.nav-link-active` style applied)
- [ ] `ng build` completes with no errors
- [ ] `ng serve` shows working navigation
- [ ] Pop-out button on Discover page opens `/popout` in a new window

## What We Accomplished

| Item | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| Routes | None | Home, Discover, Popout configured |
| Navigation | `href` (full reload) | `routerLink` (SPA navigation) |
| Active state | None | Visual highlight on current route |
| Content area | Static text | Dynamic `<router-outlet>` |
| Components | 1 (AppComponent) | 4 (App, Home, Discover, Popout) |
| URL behavior | Ignored | Foundation for state management |

## Architecture Note

All three feature components (Home, Discover, Popout) are **framework components** — they exist regardless of the domain. When we add automobile-specific functionality later:

- `HomeComponent` will remain a generic landing page
- `DiscoverComponent` will become `AutomobileDiscoverComponent` (domain-specific)
- `PopoutComponent` will remain generic (renders any domain's panels)

This separation follows the naming conventions in `053-naming-conventions.md`.
