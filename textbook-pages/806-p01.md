## Learning Objectives

After completing this section, you will:
- Understand how to render form controls dynamically from configuration
- Know how to implement debounced input handling for performance
- Be able to coordinate multiple filter types in a single panel

---

## Objective

Build a configuration-driven filter panel that renders filter controls dynamically based on `DomainConfig.filters`. This component supports multiple filter types (text, number, select, multiselect, autocomplete, range, boolean, date) and integrates with the ResourceManagementService for state updates.

---

## Why

Every data discovery application needs a way for users to filter results. The challenge is that different domains have different filter requirements: automobiles need year ranges and manufacturer dropdowns; products need category hierarchies and price ranges.

The **Query Panel Component** solves this by:

1. Reading filter definitions from `DomainConfig.filters`
2. Rendering appropriate PrimeNG controls for each filter type
3. Handling value changes with debouncing for performance
4. Syncing all filter state with URL parameters

This is the Phase 8 pattern: **Generic components + specific configuration = infinite reusability**.

### Angular Style Guide References

- [Style 03-01](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide#style-03-01): Use single responsibility principle
- [Style 05-04](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide#style-05-04): Put logic in the component class

### URL-First Architecture Reference

When a user changes a filter value:
1. The component updates its local model immediately (for UI responsiveness)
2. After debounce delay (for text inputs), it calls `ResourceManagementService.updateFilters()`
3. ResourceManagementService updates URL state
4. URL change triggers new API request

This flow ensures filters are shareable via URL and survive page refreshes.
