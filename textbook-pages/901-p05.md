## Common Problems

| Symptom | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Component not found error | Module not imported in AppModule | Add `HomeModule` to AppModule imports (done in document 906) |
| `routerLink` not working | RouterModule not imported | Ensure `RouterModule` is in the HomeModule imports |
| Styles not applying | Wrong file path in `styleUrls` | Verify the path matches the actual file location |
| Emoji not displaying | System font issue | Use an SVG icon instead, or accept platform variation |
| Grid layout broken | Browser doesn't support CSS Grid | Add fallback styles or use flexbox for older browsers |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Feature components live in feature folders** — `src/app/features/home/` keeps all home-related files together
2. **Simple components are powerful** — The Home component has no logic but serves a critical role
3. **CSS Grid enables responsive layouts** — `auto-fit` and `minmax` create layouts that adapt to any screen size

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `src/app/features/home/home.component.ts` exists with proper decorator configuration
- [ ] `src/app/features/home/home.component.html` contains header, domain card, and quickstart sections
- [ ] `src/app/features/home/home.component.scss` contains responsive grid layout styles
- [ ] `src/app/features/home/home.module.ts` declares and exports HomeComponent
- [ ] `src/app/features/home/index.ts` provides barrel exports
- [ ] Component uses `routerLink` for navigation (not `href`)
- [ ] `ng build` completes without errors

## Architecture Note

The Home component exemplifies the separation between **feature components** and **framework components**:

- **Feature components** (like Home) are page-level, application-specific
- **Framework components** (from Phase 8) are reusable across any domain

The Home component contains no domain logic — it's pure navigation and branding. This means:

- It loads instantly (no API calls)
- It never fails (no dependencies)
- It can be tested in isolation

This pattern will repeat for other feature components: they orchestrate framework components and provide page-level structure.
