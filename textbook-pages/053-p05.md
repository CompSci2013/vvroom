## Companion Book Scope

A companion book "Adding Agriculture to Vroom" would cover only:

| Chart Sources | 2-4 | Domain-specific chart transformations |
| Feature Components | 2 | Landing page, Discover page |
| Routes | 1 | Add routes to app.routes.ts |

The companion book is **~70% smaller** because all framework code is reused.
