### Step 103.7: Understanding Router Outlet

The `<router-outlet>` is a placeholder directive. When the URL changes, Angular:

1. Matches the URL against the routes array
2. Creates an instance of the matching component
3. Inserts the component's view after `<router-outlet>`

**Visual representation:**

When URL is `/home`:
```html
<main class="app-content">
  <router-outlet></router-outlet>
  <app-home>
    <div class="home-container">
      <h1>Welcome to Vvroom</h1>
      ...
    </div>
  </app-home>
</main>
```

When URL is `/discover`:
```html
<main class="app-content">
  <router-outlet></router-outlet>
  <app-discover>
    <div class="discover-container">
      <h1>Discover Vehicles</h1>
      ...
    </div>
  </app-discover>
</main>
```

The component renders as a sibling *after* the outlet, not inside it. This is why we styled `.app-content` rather than `router-outlet` — the outlet itself has no dimensions.

## The Aha Moment

**Routes are the skeleton. The URL is where state lives.**

Right now, our routes are simple: `/home`, `/discover`, `/popout`. But watch what happens when you click the navigation links:

1. The URL in your browser's address bar changes
2. The page does *not* reload
3. The content area updates instantly

This is the foundation of URL-First architecture. In later sections, we'll add query parameters to the URL:

```
/discover?make=Toyota&year=2023&page=2
```

Every piece of state — the selected make, the year filter, the current page — will be encoded in the URL. Users can:
- Bookmark their exact search
- Share the URL with colleagues
- Use the browser's back button to undo filter changes
- Refresh without losing their place

The URL becomes a serialized snapshot of application state. This section establishes the routing skeleton that makes all of this possible.

## Verification

### 1. Build the Application

```bash
$ cd ~/projects/vvroom
$ ng build
```

Expected output (no errors):

```
✔ Browser application bundle generation complete.
✔ Copying assets complete.
✔ Index html generation complete.

Note: `main.js` is slightly larger now because it includes the Router and three new components.
