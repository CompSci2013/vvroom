You are to meticulously document each action we take in building this application.
Each entry will contain a timestamp: YYYY-MM-DD_HH:MM:SS where time is the system time of the thor server.
You will always append entries to the bottom of this file: ~/projects/vvroom/journal.md
Give the timestamp of the entry, and then write the action taken on the next line.
There should be a blank line between entries.
You will add these entries automatically after each action.
After you have recorded the last action taken, you will read the first 11 lines of this file.
Then tail the last 150 lines of this file, journal.md, to remember where you left off.
After each successful test as verified by playwrite screenshot, commit the work, then push to all remote repositories.
Add a blank line, then a time-stamped entry for the test just performed.
You will then read quality-instructions.md

# Textbook Quality Review Journal

## Purpose

This journal tracks the quality review and testing of the vvroom textbook located at `~/projects/vvroom/textbook/`. The review verifies that textbook content accurately describes the implemented application and that code examples produce the expected behavior.

### Quality Criteria

Each chapter will be reviewed against:

1. **Code Accuracy**: Does the code compile and run as described?
2. **API Compliance**: Do examples match `quality-instructions.md` test expectations?
3. **URL-First Adherence**: Does the chapter correctly implement URL-first state management?
4. **Data Attributes**: Are required `data-testid` attributes documented?
5. **Cross-References**: Do chapter references point to correct locations?

## Review Protocol

For each chapter:
1. Read chapter content
2. Compare code examples against actual implementation in `src/`
3. Verify any Playwright test expectations match `quality-instructions.md`
4. Run relevant tests if applicable
5. Document findings with timestamp
6. If issues found, create correction notes
